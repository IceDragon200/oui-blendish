**Blendish** is a small collection of drawing functions for [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) in a single C header file, designed to replicate the look of the Blender 2.5+ User Interface. You can use these functions to theme your UI library. Some metric constants for faithful reproduction are also included.

To render correctly, Blendish needs both [icon sheet](https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-blender/trunk/blender/release/datafiles/blender_icons16.png) and [font](https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-blender/trunk/blender/release/datafiles/fonts/) from the 
Blender repository. See source code for more information.
